# `hush grant`

!!!
Not illustrated in a gif to not expose secret information.
!!!

To grant another IAM user **in the same AWS account** access to your secret, use the `grant` command like this:

`yarn hush grant joern-prod <user-identifier>`

**`user-identifier` has to be _either_ an AWS ARN _or_ a username for a user that shares an AWS account with you.**
