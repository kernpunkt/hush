# Hush! ðŸ¤«

**Hush!** is a small tool to facilitate the **sharing of `.env`** files between developers without having to send them over Teams messages. It uses the **AWS SecretsManager** to store a new secret for each of your `.env` files.

With Hush!, you can _finally_ store secrets like API tokens or passwords securely.

If you're unsure where to start using Hush!, we recommend the **[Installation guide](https://hush.kernpunkt.de/getting-started/installation)**. Or maybe you're feeling adventurous and would like to **[deploy your first secret](https://hush.kernpunkt.de/getting-started/deploying-your-first-secret)** or **[take a look at the commands Hush! offers](https://hush.kernpunkt.de/commands)**.
